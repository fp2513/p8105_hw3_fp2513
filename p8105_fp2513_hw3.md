Size of dataset before data cleaning: 7 variables (columns) and 2595176
observations (rows).

Variable names include: id, date, prcp, snow, snwd, tmax, tmin.

There is a significant amount of missing data

``` r
filter(ny_noaa, (is.na(snow) | snow == "") &
         (is.na(tmin) | tmin == "") &
         (is.na(tmax) | tmax == "") &
         (is.na(prcp) | prcp == "")) %>% 
  nrow()
```

    ## [1] 73950

There are 73950 rows that have missing data in all four columns tmax,
tmin, prcp, and snow.

``` r
filter(ny_noaa, (is.na(tmin) | tmin == "") &
         (is.na(tmax) | tmax == "")) %>% 
  nrow()
```

    ## [1] 1132502

And 1132502 rows that have missing data for both coloumns tmax and tmin.

The missing data is an issue, as there is inconsistancy in the data /
information.

**Do some data cleaning. Create separate variables for year, month, and
day.**

``` r
dated_ny_noaa = 
  ny_noaa %>% 
  mutate(
    year = year(date),
    month = month(date),
    day = day(date)
  ) %>% 
  select(-date)
```

**Ensure observations for temperature, precipitation, and snowfall are
given in reasonable units.**

Current units â€“\>

- temperature in 10ths of degrees celcius (need to be converted to whole
  degrees celcius)

- precipitation in tenths of mm (to be converted to mm)

- snowfall in mm (can remain in mm or converted to cm)

``` r
dated_ny_noaa = 
  dated_ny_noaa %>% 
  mutate(tmax = as.integer(tmax), 
         tmin = as.integer(tmin)) %>% 
  mutate(tmax = tmax / 10, 
         tmin = tmin / 10, 
         prcp = prcp / 10)
```

**For snowfall, what are the most commonly observed values? Why?**

``` r
dated_ny_noaa %>% 
  filter(snow > 0) %>%
  group_by(snow) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 5) %>%
  pull(snow)              
```

    ## [1] 25 13 51 76  8

Most commonly observed value was 0 snowfall, followed by 25, 13, 51 and
76mm of snow fall.

This is consistent with the fact that it only snows in the coldest
months of winter in NY therefore majority of the observations will have
0 snow. It is also noted that on average, NYC sees around 29.8 inches of
snow in a season which is relatively consistent with the most commonly
observed values of snowfall in this data frame.
